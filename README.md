<br/>

A Discord Bot written in Rust, configurable through YAML and supporting WASM plugins for enhanced functionality.

> [!NOTE]  
> We are still in active development working towards an initial stable release.

## Features

Work in Progress:

-   **YAML Configuration:** Easily customize the bot's configuration using simple YAML files.
-   **WASM Plugin Support:** Extend the bot's capabilities with custom WebAssembly plugins.

## Installation

All stable builds and the latest development build can be downloaded directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/paperback-community/discord-bot/releases). Make sure to select the build specific for your OS and chipset.

> [!NOTE]  
> You may need to build the application yourself if your OS or chipset is not listed.

### Stable Version

The stable build is released less frequently, typically after a thorough testing period. Because of this, it generally experiences fewer bugs and is recommended for production use.

### Development build

The development build is generated automatically after every push to the `master` branch. While it allows users to access the latest features and improvements, it is generally discouraged for production environments, as bugs can be introduced at any time.

> [!WARNING]  
> Only use this version if you are familiar with potential risks. We are not liable for any issues you may encounter.
